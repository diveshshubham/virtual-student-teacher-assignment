            In this application there are two types of user - Teacher and student
          </p>
          <p>
            When teacher creates assignment and he publishes it then every student of that particular teacher will be notified and the same assigment will be mapped to student id of student.
          </p>
          <p>
            when teacher creates assignment and does not publishes it then it will automatically get published on it's start date as cron jobs will be running on server which will run twice a day to remind teacher for publishing assignment if not published , remind student to complete assignment before end date as well as auto publish assignment on its start date.
          </p>
          <p>A student can see only published assignments</p>
